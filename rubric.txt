TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

The biggest potential problem is that people could replace real humans with chatbots in their social life, similar to what was shown in the movie Her (2013). Another problem is that there would be more risk of widespread misinformation because more human-like chatbots probably appear to be more trustworthy, when in reality they are giving users unverified information that was blindly picked up from their training data.
One way for engineers to ensure that users perceive chatbots as non-human is to randomly insert non-sensical texts into chatbot responses without changing their meaning or making them difficult to understand. For example, instead of saying 'How can I help you today?', the chatbot could say 'How can I &0R$* help you today?' Another way is to have chatbots speak in a distinctly robotic and non-human voice whenever they are prompted to read their response. This way, users will always be reminded that chatbots are not human.
